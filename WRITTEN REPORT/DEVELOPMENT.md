CS 225: Data Structures and Algorithms

Final Project Development

Note: Development log was originally recorded in google documents and transferred to GitHub when wrapping up the project. Walker acted as the scribe in recording the log after each week shown below.

Week One (11/1 - 11/7): 
During week one, we were assigned our team on Thursday. We created a Discord chat for communication the following day. Additionally, we held our first meeting on Sunday to complete the final project proposal document. This document included establishing a weekly meeting time, subgroups for our team, the project and traversals we desire to complete within the project, and a timeline for our intended progress.

Week Two (11/8 - 11/14): 
This week began our work on processing the data and beginning our work on the GraphStructure class and other complimentary classes. We were able to successfully import airport and route data into the project, and now are working on simplifying the data to only represent parameters we need for airports (IATA ID, latitude, and longitude) and routes (incoming IATA ID and outgoing IATA ID). Additionally, we were able to start the Edge and Vertex classes along with their respective functions. Throughout this week, we clarified our goals, calculation tactics, and how we were going to coordinate GitHub pushing and pulling.

Week Three (11/15 - 11/21): 
We were informed of a few updates to be made for our final project proposal, so the first thing we did was make sure the proposal was complete and approved. We managed to get a better understanding of some of the multiple helper functions needed to make implementation of future algorithms easier. Next, we shifted to our intentions for the three algorithms we chose and specifically how the weights of the edges would be computed. Finally, we worked on understanding the DFS traversal using the pseudocode outlined in the CS225 notes. We did not complete the DFS traversal, but we were able to get a better idea of how to go about it.

Week Four (11/22 - 11/28): 
During fall break, our team desired to make this week a lighter load for all members. Thus, we collectively worked to research the IDDFS traversal. Because it was the code not taught in class, we wanted our group to have a solid foundation of what an IDDFS does. We were able to find pseudocode online to function as our basis.

Week Five (11/29 - 12/5): 
This week we had our mid-project check in. Throughout the check in, Vlas was able to inform us of a few things. First, he told us to make sure we include example outputs in the submission. Additionally, he told us we need executables and to make sure that each algorithm can be run via the command line. Finally, he let us know we should have at least one simple test case for each algorithm upon submission. Throughout week five we also attempted to complete Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm using the pseudocode outlined in the CS225 notes, but were not able to complete it by the end of the week.

Week Six (12/6 - 12/13):
Throughout the final week of the project, we wrote and finished up every function that had issues throughout the project and we finished the main.cpp file in order to have our project run in a manner we believe is effective. This file contains our code for taking in user input as well as displaying our output results. We worked to complete our test cases as well as our executables. Additionally, we compiled all of our google documents data into md files in the GitHub, and recorded our final video presentation for the project. We recorded the video over Zoom using a slideshow presentation, which our group felt was best suited to all equal engagement of all members.
