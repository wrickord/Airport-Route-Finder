# Team Contract (dbk3-js52-ajsun2-walkerr2)

## Communication

### 1. Team Meetings 
Our team will meet at least once a week every Wednesday from 4-6 PM, and Sunday from 1-3 PM if 
necessary (in person or over Discord). Subteam meetings will be decided on a weekly basis between 
partners. Justin will be the designated note-taker, but team members will step in when necessary. 
Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also
responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the 
start of the following week’s meeting.
### 2. Assistance 
Each team member can be contacted through iMessage or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other 
commitments, we commit to responding to messages within 12 hours.
### 3. Respect 
All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred,
it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering
to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration 
### 1. Work Distribution 
Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and 
each subteam will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. If neither subteams volunteer, 
then we will alternate between being assigned unwanted tasks. If this leads to an unbalanced 
workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. 
### 2. Time Commitment 
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to
independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.
If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist
with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or
programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to
make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked –
politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such
as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team
members.
### 3. Conflict Resolution 
All conflicts within the team will be decided by coin flip. Winner gets final say.
